# VP_RPE_2020
Data and analysis for our 2020 manuscript on RPE signaling in ventral pallidum.

All of the preprocessed data is available in “Data.zip" at https://gin.g-node.org/djottenheimer/VP_RPE_2020. There you can also find Matlab files created with scripts in the MatlabScripts folders “1_InitialAnalysis” and “2_Modeling”

You can generate most of the figures in the paper by downloading the Data folder (from the Data.zip file) and the MatlabScripts folder, adding both folders to your Matlab path, and running the scripts in the MatlabScripts folder “3_Figures” — particularly “MainFigures.m”, as well as the scripts in “AdditionalFigures.”

You'll want to change the pathname in "MatlabScripts/HelperFunctions/ottBari2020_root.m" to the folder that contains the Data folder.
